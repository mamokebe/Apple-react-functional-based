# Apple clone by React JS

This project contains backend, Frontend and API (youtube API) that is built using React.js + vite and Node.js.

For the backend, I used Express for my server and MySql for my database. My API is serving the iphone page from the database.

For the frontend, I added some current apple youtube to the website by using a third party API from Google Cloud,
so anyone can have access to Apple's youTube channel straight from the website.

run npm install from inside the backend directory and  frontend directory.

- cd backend:  npm i

Create a .env file in the backend and frontend directory and create server port number, api key and channel id.

- VITE_PORT = <your_server_port_number>
