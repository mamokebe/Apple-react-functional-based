# Apple clone by React JS

This project contains backend, Frontend and API (youtube API) that is built using React.js + vite and Node.js 
For the backend, I used Express for my server and MySql for my database. My REST-API is serving the iphone page from the database.

For the frontend, I added some current apple youtube to the website by using a third party API from Google Cloud,
so anyone can have access to Apple's youTube channel straight from the website.
